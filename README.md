## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS** 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- **FFmpeg** (Required for audio processing)
- ~500MB disk space (for whisper.cpp and models)

> **Note:** WhisperDesk requires FFmpeg to process audio files. The app will check for it on startup and guide you if it's missing.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Install Prerequisites

WhisperDesk requires **FFmpeg** to be installed on your system to process audio and video files.

#### Install Homebrew (if not already installed)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### Install FFmpeg

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### Install CMake (for building whisper.cpp)

```bash
brew install cmake
```

### 2. Install WhisperDesk

#### Option A: Download DMG (Recommended)

1. Download the latest `WhisperDesk-x.x.x.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/PVAS-Development/whisperdesk/releases)
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag WhisperDesk to your Applications folder
4. **Important:** Ensure you have FFmpeg installed (see [Prerequisites](#1-install-prerequisites))
5. Launch WhisperDesk from Applications

#### Option B: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PVAS-Development/whisperdesk.git
cd whisperdesk

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build whisper.cpp with Metal support (downloads base model)
# For development (current architecture only):
npm run setup:whisper

# For production (universal binary - Intel + Apple Silicon):
npm run setup:whisper:universal

# Run in development mode
npm run electron:dev

# Or build for production (automatically builds universal binary)
npm run electron:build
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Open Files** - Drag and drop audio/video files (single or batch) into the app, or click to browse
2. **Configure Settings** - Choose your preferred model, language, and output format
3. **Transcribe** - Click "Transcribe" to process the entire queue sequentially
4. **Save/Copy** - Save the transcription from the save dialog (choose from `.txt`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.md`, `.srt`, or `.vtt` formats) or copy to clipboard

### Architecture

This project follows a modern Electron architecture with strict separation of concerns:

- **`src/main/`**: Electron Main process (TypeScript). Handles OS integration, window management, and native services.
- **`src/preload/`**: Preload scripts (TypeScript). Exposes a secure, typed API to the renderer via `contextBridge`.
- **`src/renderer/`**: React application (TypeScript). The UI layer, built with Vite.
- **`src/shared/`**: Shared types and constants used by both Main and Renderer processes.

**Security Features:**

- **Context Isolation**: Enabled. Renderer cannot access Node.js primitives directly.
- **Sandbox**: Enabled. Renderer runs in a sandboxed environment.
- **IPC**: All communication happens via typed IPC channels defined in `src/main/ipc/`.

```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "whisper.cpp not found" error

Run the setup script to build whisper.cpp:

```bash
npm run setup:whisper
```

### "FFmpeg not found" error

Install FFmpeg via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### Slow transcription

- Use a smaller model (tiny or base) for faster results
- Ensure you're using GPU acceleration (shown in app settings)
- Close other resource-intensive applications

### App won't open (macOS Gatekeeper)

The app is **code-signed and notarized** by Apple, so it should open normally. If you still see a warning:

1. Right-click the app and select "Open"
2. Click "Open" in the dialog that appears

For builds from source (unsigned), you may need to run:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/WhisperDesk.app
```
